**Type** Plugin

**Description**  
This Capture Works plugin allows users to automatically align point clouds acquired by multiple Altiz devices using a simple bar with holes.
The distance between the holes must be known precisely. This plugin does not correct rotations around the X-axis or the Z-axis.
It is therefore important to position the camera in such a way that no rotations occur around these axes.
The distances between the holes are measured along the Altiz X-axis.

Complete documentation can be found in this Git repository.
